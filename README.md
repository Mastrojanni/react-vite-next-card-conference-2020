# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Env

Example of env;

VITE_APP_DEV_BASE_URL=""
VITE_APP_PROD_BASE_URL_PORT=""

## Description

This app aims to copy a card from the next-js conference of 2020, I had no time to implement the footer disclaimer so I had to use a SVG.
The secondary aim of this app is to implement the above card with a resizable card container having all of its content elements resize in percentage.

## How to start this project

- open terminal at root
- npm i
- npm run dev

or if you prefer you can use pnpm
